Questions

Q. What is a Node module?

> A Node module is similar to JavaScript library, functions that one can import into an application

Q> What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

> module.exports is an empty object that can have functions and variables directly assigned to it. exports is a reference to the module.exports object.

Q. Why is using exports recommended?

> exports is a reference to module.exports. As exports cannot be reassigned, we can use it outside the module without reassigning the actual object ny mistake
